we need to take name email password from user and
once user input everything all details need to print 
on next js - home jsp



Reg.jsp 
	input 
	submit 

when user press submit all data will send in request ->
on server -> inside RegiServlet --> 

read all data and set into request --> setAttribute()

 [ validation -> set isError flag true if any data is missing other wise default isError is false ]
 [ if user miss any input please add error message for that field and then jumbp back to reg.jsp ] 
 [ you need to decide if we need to go home.jsp or Reg.jsp based on isError value] 
 
now use RequestDispatcher to jump to the next jsp -> Home.jsp 

Home.jsp-> read all data using getAttribute and print it.


some times user does not input some data . we need to take care of that miss data. 
so we need to perform validation but we dont want to use js. so ? 
we are going to write this logic inside controller/ servlet , we can write this logic before jumping to next jsp
